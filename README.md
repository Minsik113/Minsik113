### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Minsik113/Minsik113** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

This repository is a collection of my personal projects and the things I've studied along the way.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working in the financial sector, primarily handling web server operations.
- ðŸŒ± I manage both Java and Node.js servers, and also work on front-end development. As a result, the programming languages I use most frequently are JavaScript and Java.
- ðŸ’¬ Before starting my current job, I was deeply interested in machine learning and data analysis. Although my focus has shifted to my main work, I still enjoy discussing topics related to AI whenever I get the chance.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: hyunicho62@gmail.com

  
In my spare time, I'm studying data structures and algorithms, with the goal of deepening my proficiency in Java and improving my overall understanding of the language.

Feel free to explore my work, and let's connect if you're interested in discussing technology or collaborating!
